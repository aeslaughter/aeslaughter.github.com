Andrew E. Slaughter
==============

Welcome
-----------
Curently, I am a Computational Scientist at [Idaho National Laboratory](http://www.inl.gov) developing the Multiphysics Object-Oriented Simulation Environment (MOOSE).

This page gives a brief overview of my research, teaching interests, and open-source code projects. For a more complete information please contact me at andrew.e.slaughter@gmail.com for a complete Ciriculum Vitae.

Education
-----------

* [Montana State University (MSU)](http://www.montana.edu), 2010, PhD in Applied Mechanics
* [Washington State University (WSU)](http://www.wsu.edu), 2004, MS in Civil Engineering
* [Michigan Technological University (MTU)](http://www.mtu.edu), 2002, BS in Civil Engineering

Research Interests
--------------------
My primary research interest is understanding and modeling snow, especially as it relates to avalanches. Continuing this focus, I aim to develop a generalized, physics-based, multi-scale 3D model for snow—a model that may be customized to fit a variety of purposes from water resource engineering to hazard mitigation.

Teaching Interests
--------------------
I am most interested in teaching courses in engineering and numerical methods, such as flow in porous media and continuum mechanics. I also would like to continue instructing fundamental engineering courses such as statics, mechanics, structural analysis, and finite element analysis. I am also interested in developing innovative curriculum, for example, a snow and ice mechanics course that covers topics such as the transversely isotropic properties of ice, thermal and micro-structural models of snow, and avalanche flow dynamics. I also would enjoy developing a graduate level course focusing on statistical applications in research.

Past Projects
--------------
#### [National Science Founcation](http://www.nsf.gov) [Postdoctoral Fellow](www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=503144) at [Cornell University](http://www.cornell.edu)
["A Stochastic Phase-tracking Snow Micro-structure Model."](www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=1049501) - [Project Code](http://aeslaughter.github.com/postdoc)
The objective of the work proposed was to research the use of stochastic, phase-tracking finite element techniques common in modeling alloy solidification to model the evolution of the snow micro-structure.

#### PhD research
["Numerical analysis of conditions necessary for near-surface snow metamorphism."](http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/view/item.php?id=1097)
Utilized sensitivity analysis and a heat-transfer model to isolate important factors in near-surface metamorphism. 

#### MS resarch
["Design and Fatigue of a Structural Wood-Plastic Composite."](http://www.dissertations.wsu.edu/Thesis/Summer2004/a_slaughter_072704.pdf)
Designed and tested wood-plastic composite bridge decking for pedestrian bridge structures and oversaw installation of a unique composite foundation/column connection.

Outreach: GK—12
-------------------
[**Download the Snow Science Ciriculum**](http://aeslaughter.github.com/docs/snowscience.pdf)
A science curriculum centered on snow and avalanches was implemented in a 5th grade classroom at Ophir School in Big Sky, MT. The curriculum content was developed by a PhD student as a part of the Graduate Teaching Fellows in K—12 Education Program (GK—12) of the National Science Foundation. The purpose of the curriculum was foremost to provide inquiry-based scientific content that both stimulated and motivated the students. Throughout the academic year, lessons, exercises, and field trips were conducted with particular focus on the decision-making triangle of snow, weather, and terrain. Various resources were utilized including assistance from the Gallatin National Forest Avalanche Center and the Big Sky Ski Patrol. One of the most important aspects of the curriculum is that the 5th grade students were able to participate in the education processes themselves which culminated in their development of a professional-quality poster. The poster was constructed for use as an educational tool for other grade school students and was presented, by the students, at the 2008 International Snow Science Workshop. Overall, the curriculum succeeded in exciting the students about science, with particular emphasis on snow science.

Open Source Software Developed
--------------------------------------
I have developed a number of programs that are available on my [GitHub](http://github.com) site: [github.com/aeslaughter](http://github.com/aeslaughter). Below is a list and brief discussion explaining the work.

* Multiphisics Object Oriented Simulation Environment (MOOSE): A finite-element, multiphysics framework that provides a high-level interface to highly sophisticated nonlinear solver technology.
* [mFEM](http://aeslaughter.github.com/mFEM): A object oriented MATLAB finite element library designed for education and rapid problem solving, including automatic assembly routines. 
* [YCweather](http://aeslaughter.github.com/YCweather):  A tool for organizing and accessing weather data and field observations of near-surface metamorphism of snow. Details
of the project that the software was designed for is provided in the article:  ["Field investigation of near-surface metamorphism of snow."](http://www.igsoc.org:8080/journal/57/203/j10J090.pdf).
* [Snow Optics Toolbox](http://github.com/aeslaughter/optics): A set of MATLAB programs for viewing and analyzing images of snow developed for the study of the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF). This software was developed as a part of my MSU postdoctoral research.
* [Snow Thermal Model](http://github.com/aeslaughter/thermal): A MATLAB based snow thermal model that was the basis of my PhD research.
* [SMPToolkit](http://github.com/aeslaughter/SMPtoolkit): A MATLAB program for viewing and analyzing snow mirco penatrometer (SMP) data.
