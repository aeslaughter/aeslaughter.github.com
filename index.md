Real-World Results
------------------
The MOOSE simulation platform at has demonstrated the possibility of realistic modeling a full-core commercial nuclear reactor over multiple operating cycles. This simulation demonstrates the ability to couple several models together to simulate numerous physical properties on multiple size and time scales.
