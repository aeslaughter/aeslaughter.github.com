Computational Scientist at [Idaho National Laboratory](www.inl.gov)

Welcome
-----------
Curently, I am a Computational Scientist at Idaho National Laboratory developing the Multiphysics Object-Oriented Simulation Environment (MOOSE).

This page gives a brief overview of my research, teaching interests, and open-source code projects. For a more complete information please contact me at andrew.e.slaughter@gmail.com for a complete Ciriculum Vitae.

Education
------------
* [Montana State University (MSU)](www.montana.edu), 2010, PhD in Applied Mechanics
* [Washington State University (WSU)](www.wsu.edu), 2004, MS in Civil Engineering
* [Michigan Technological University (MTU)](www.mtu.edu), 2002, BS in Civil Engineering

Research Interests
--------------------
My primary research interest is understanding and modeling snow, especially as it relates to avalanches. Continuing this focus, I aim to develop a generalized, physics-based, multi-scale 3D model for snowâ€”a model that may be customized to fit a variety of purposes from water resource engineering to hazard mitigation.

Teaching Interests
--------------------
I am most interested in teaching courses in engineering and numerical methods, such as flow in porous media and continuum mechanics. I also would like to continue instructing fundamental engineering courses such as statics, mechanics, structural analysis, and finite element analysis. I am also interested in developing innovative curriculum, for example, a snow and ice mechanics course that covers topics such as the transversely isotropic properties of ice, thermal and micro-structural models of snow, and avalanche flow dynamics. I also would enjoy developing a graduate level course focusing on statistical applications in research.
