<h3>Welcome</h3>
<p>
<img src="http://aeslaughter.github.com/docs/me.png" alt="Andrew E Slaughter near the summit of Mt. Whitney" align="right" width=250/>
I am currently a National Science Foundation Postdoctoral fellow working at 
<a href="http://www.cornell.edu">Cornell University</a> and the <a href="http://mpdc.mae.cornell.edu">Materials Process Design and Control Laboratory</a>. My work is focused on researching the application of finite element methods to model the micro-structure evolution of snow.  The resulting model will assist in gaining further understanding the complex nature of snow metamorphism, which will aid in the prediction of weak-layer formation within the snowpack.</p>

<p>This page gives a brief overview of my research, teaching interests, and open-source code projects. A more complete synaposis please refer to my <a href="http://aeslaughter.github.com/docs/vitae.pdf">Ciriculum Vitae</a> or contact me at <a href="mailto:andrew.e.slaughter@gmail.com">andrew.e.slaughter@gmail.com</a>.

<h3>Current Project: &nbsp; <a href="http://aeslaughter.github.com/postdoc/"> aeslaughter.github.com/postdoc</a> </h3>
<p>Currently at <a href="http://www.cornell.edu">CU</a> after I was awarded a Earth Science Postdoctoral Fellowship from the <a href="http://www.nsf.gov"/>National Science Foundation (NSF)</a>. The proposed work is to explore new methods for modeling the behavior of snow. The goal is to research the use of stochastic finite element methods to model the evolution of the snow micro-structure including phase change within the snow. A model of this type would improve the current understanding of snow metamorphism by providing a means to monitor the evolution of the ice matrix within the snow while accounting for uncertainties in the system.</p>

	<li><b>NSF Award Annoucment:</b><a href="http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=1049501"> "A Stochastic Phase-tracking Snow Micro-structure Model."</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Research Interests</h3>
<p>My primary research interest is understanding and modeling snow, evidenced by my projects at both <a href="http://www.montana.edu">MSU</a> and <a href="http://www.cornell.edu">CU</a>, especially as it relates to avalanches. Continuing this focus, I aim to develop a generalized, physics-based, multi-scale 3D model for snow&mdash;a model that may be customized to fit a variety of purposes from water resource engineering to hazard mitigation. </p>

<h3>Teaching Interests</h3>
<p>I am most interested in teaching courses in engineering and numerical methods, such as flow in porous media and continuum mechanics. I also would like to continue instructing fundamental engineering courses such as statics, mechanics, structural analysis, and finite element analysis. I am also interested in developing innovative curriculum, for example, a snow and ice mechanics course that covers topics such as the transversely isotropic properties of ice, thermal and micro-structural models of snow, and avalanche flow dynamics. I also would enjoy developing a graduate level course focusing on statistical applications in research.</p>

<h3>Open Source Projects</h3>
I have developed a number of programs that are available on my <a href="http://github.com"> github</a> site: <a href="https://github.com/aeslaughter"> github.com/aeslaughter</a>. Below is a list and brief discussion explaining the work.<br>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://aeslaughter.github.com/YCweather/" >YCweather</a>: A tool for organizing 
and accessing weather data and field observations of near-surface metamorphism of snow. Details
of the project that the software was designed for is provided in the article: <a href="http://www.igsoc.org:8080/journal/57/203/j10J090.pdf"> "Field investigation of near-surface metamorphism of snow." </a></li>

<li><a href="https://github.com/aeslaughter/optics" > Snow Optics Toolbox</a>: A set of MATLAB programs for viewing and analyzing images of snow developed for the study of the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF). This software was developed as a part of my MSU postdoctoral research.</li>

<li><a href="https://github.com/aeslaughter/thermal"> Snow Thermal Model</a>: A MATLAB based snow thermal model that was the basis of my PhD research.</li>  

<li><a href="https://github.com/aeslaughter/SMPtoolkit"> SMPToolkit</a>: A MATLAB program for viewing and analyzing snow mirco penatrometer (SMP) data. </li>
